Hi! I'm Itai, a software engineer from Israel, currently working at Flytrex. I develop full-stack apps, maintain some OSS projects, and enjoy life. This website contains details on some of my projects, as well as my thoughts and experiences from working as a software engineer.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to do so via <SocialLink service="email">email</SocialLink> or <SocialLink service="twitter">Twitter</SocialLink>. You can also find my CV [here](/cv.pdf) (last updated August 2019).

<!-- TODO: Use some social badges (GitHub, Twitter, DEV, StackOverflow, LinkedIn) instead of this. -->

<!-- TODO: Also write about Google Code-In, the Hacktoberfest events I organized, other projects (short), what I did before OSS (C#, PHP, VB), uni? -->

For those who are interested in reading even more about me, I've divided the rest of the stuff into collapsible sections, for your convenience:

<details>
<summary>How I got into coding</summary>

I first learned about the concept of coding when I was 10 years old, by watching a YouTube tutorial showing how to develop a basic Windows Forms application using Visual Basic. The app was dumb and useless, but I became fascinated with programming, and went on to develop more apps.

In the 3 years that followed, I learned by myself C#, PHP, JS (as well as HTML & CSS), and worked on projects for fun, doing my own thing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>OSS work</summary>

I've been contributing to and maintaining [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) projects for the last 5 years, and love collaborating with cool and smart people from all around the world.

One of the more popular projects I maintain (along with the awesome Sindre Sorhus and Sam Verschueren) is [`np`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np), which is a CLI for Node.js developers that simplifies your entire publishing workflow to a single command, and includes many best practices and useful features built-in. I usually triage issues, review PRs and contribute to different parts of the codebase, while continuously working with others and maintaining a high level of code quality and architecture standards.

Other cool projects I've made include [`videos`](https://github.com/itaisteinherz/videos) and [MChat](https://github.com/itaisteinherz/MChat).

<summary>Collaborative coding</summary>

Almost 2 years ago, I participated in a [Chingu](https://chingu.io) collaborative coding cohort. I led a team of 5 developers from Israel, Italy, Greece, and the US. Together, we developed [Knowledge](http://github.com/chingu-voyage7/Bears-Team-22), an online platform for asking questions and getting answers. During the cohort I got to learn about leading a team of developers, working around deadlines, quickly iterating over ideas, and collaborating with people coming from different backgrounds and places.

<details>
<summary>Programming contests</summary>

I don't usually do programming contests, though I did participate in [Google Code-in 2018](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/), an online contest that introduced pre-university students to OSS development. During the contest, I worked with volunteers from [CloudCV](https://cloudcv.org) on several AI research-related projects. The contest was 3 months long, I was ended up as a finalist.

<details>
<summary>More stuff I'm interested in</summary>

Apart from high-level programming, I also have experience with low-level programming using C and Assembly, and like to fiddle with information security and play CTFs from time to time.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What I do for fun</summary>

When I'm not coding, I'm typically:

- watching some movie or Netflix show;
- hanging out with friends;
- playing the piano;
- running;
- or traveling.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What I currently do</summary>

I currently work as a software developer at [Flytrex](https://flytrex.com), an Israeli startup focused on making drone deliveries a reality. At work, I mostly use Python, TypeScript, Docker, and AWS (as well as other technologies and services).
