Hi! I'm Itai, a software engineer from Israel, currently working at Flytrex. I develop full-stack apps & tools, maintain some OSS projects, and enjoy life. This website contains details on some of my projects, as well as my thoughts and experiences from working as a software engineer.

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to do so via <SocialLink service="email">email</SocialLink> or <SocialLink service="twitter">Twitter</SocialLink>. You can also find my CV [here](/cv.pdf) (last updated August 2019).

<!-- TODO: Use some social badges (GitHub, Twitter, DEV, StackOverflow, LinkedIn) instead of this. -->
