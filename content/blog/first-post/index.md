Welcome to my new blog 👋🏻

My name is [Itai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itai) Steinherz, and I'm a 16 y/o student and software developer from Israel. Though the posts' topics may vary, they will mostly be about software development. [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/itaisteinherz) to get updates along the way, as I write and post more content.

This blog is powered by [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), an awesome static site generator, and is based on the [Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). It also uses the [Fairy Gates typography theme](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typography.js/tree/master/packages/typography-theme-fairy-gates).

You can see the full source code of the website [here](https://github.com/itaisteinherz/netoani.com).
