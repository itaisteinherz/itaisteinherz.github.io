description: This post will go over how I look at open-source in general and Hacktoberfest more specifically, and how you can take part in improving the software world.

## Motivation for this post

Following [core issues with Hacktoberfest that maintainers surfaced during the beginning of this year's Hacktoberfest](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/), DigitalOcean [made Hacktoberfest 2020 opt-in](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update). However, I think that this only improves one aspect of the real problem.

While maintainers are no longer forced to deal with all swag-seeking random contributors, many people simply don't know how to contribute to OSS in a way that's meaningful and helpful. Because of this, I wanted to write a blogpost on my own OSS contributions, and how you can make a positive impact on OSS, instead of a negative one.


## What is Hacktoberfest

In case you're unfamiliar with Hacktoberfest, [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is an online event happening worldwide every October, where contributors are awarded some swag (T-shirts and stickers) for making contributions to open-source software (OSS).


## My contributions to OSS

I actually first started contributing to OSS through Hacktoberfest 2017, as I like free stuff and coding. My first contributions were simple documentation improvements, typo fixes, and such. I liked interacting with nice developers from all over the world, and found OSS to be a nice way to explore cool projects.

After my first Hacktoberfest, I wanted to make more significant contributions to OSS projects, and so I looked for mature projects where I could step up, commit to working on more complex tasks, and work with the maintainers to get my work merged.

These days, when I'm looking to OSS, I try to look for projects which I either use myself, or that I'm familiar with (as a user). I also look for projects that are actively maintained. This way, I know that the time invested in my contribution will not to go waste, and that it will actually make a difference.


## What Hacktoberfest means for me

To me, Hacktoberfest isn't about quick typo fixes or adding superlatives to READMEs (though I must admit I did do these types of changes a few times). Rather, it's about familiarizing the global developer community with the OSS world, encouraging developers to contribute to OSS, as well as shining a light on these projects, and helping their maintainers with the burden of maintaining software for free.


## How you can make a positive impact on OSS

I'd recommend to developers who are new to OSS to start with looking for the right projects to contribute to. You can browse [the Hacktoberfest GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest) to find participating projects, and look for:

- projects that look interesting to you;
- that you're familiar with the programming languages they're written in;
- that are actively maintained (i.e. new commits are made in them regularly);
- that have clear contributing guidelines (i.e. a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repo itself/relevant section in the readme).

This way, you'll know you're in the right place for you to start contributing.

Then, look in the repo's `Issues` page for issues that are ready for people to claim. That is, nobody said they're already working on them, and they were created by the maintainers/approved by them.
