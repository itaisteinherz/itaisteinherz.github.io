description: This post will go over how I look at open-source in general and Hacktoberfest more specifically, and how you can take part in improving the software world.

## Motivation for this post

Following [core issues with Hacktoberfest that maintainers surfaced during the beginning of this year's Hacktoberfest](https://blog.domenic.me/hacktoberfest/), DigitalOcean [made Hacktoberfest 2020 opt-in](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update). However, I think that this only improves one aspect of the real problem.

While people are not incentivized anymore to create PRs in repos which aren't interested in dealing with them, many people simply don't know how to make meaningful and helpful contributions. Because of this, I wanted to write a blogpost on my own OSS contributions, and how you can make a positive impact on OSS, instead of a negative one.


## What is Hacktoberfest

In case you're unfamiliar with Hacktoberfest, [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is an online event happening worldwide every October, where contributors are awarded some swag (T-shirts and stickers) for making contributions to open-source software (OSS). The main goals of Hacktoberfest are to encourage more people to contribute to OSS, as well as to shine a light on these projects, and help their maintainers.


## My contributions to OSS

I actually first started contributing to OSS through Hacktoberfest 2017, as I like free stuff and coding. My first contributions were simple documentation improvements, typo fixes, and such. I liked interacting with nice developers from all over the world, and found OSS to be a nice way to explore cool projects.

After my first Hacktoberfest, I wanted to make more significant contributions to OSS projects, and so I looked for mature projects where I could step up, commit to working on more complex tasks, and work with the maintainers in order to get my work merged.
